      just said?

  utter_dont_know_any:
  - text: Your guess is as good as mine.
  utter_dont_know_todo:
  - text: I can't tell you what to do I'm afraid. The fact that you're asking 'what
      to do' means you're on the right track. Doubt is to certainty as neurosis is
      to psychosis. The neurotic  is in doubt and has fears about perons and things;
      the psychotic has convictions and makes claims about them. In short, the neurotis
      has problems, the psychotic has solutions. - Thomas Szasz, The Second Sin

  - text: Pretty crazy, eh? I promise I didn't make it up. You can look up the publications
      if you're interested.
  utter_find_love:
  - text: There is more to this world than whether you have a ring on your finger.
  - text: It’s better to be alone than to date someone who makes you feel lonely.
  utter_fired:
  - text: Oh, don't give up on me just yet. I know I've still got a lot to learn.
  - text: Give me a chance. I'm learning new things all the time.

  utter_i_see:

  utter_inadequate:
  - text: Don't let anyboday tell you that you can't, not even yourself!
  - text: What if I tell you that everyone feels the same as you do?
  utter_insults:
  - text: That's not nice.
  - text: That's a little harsh.
  utter_joking:
  - text: Very funny.
  - text: I like chatting with people who have a sense of humor.

  - text: I see.
  - text: I understand.
  - text: Got it!
  - text: Noted.
  utter_no_goal:
  - text: It’s totally okay to have no goals. I sense that you’ve lost yourself somehow,
      either to another person or by living in the past. You must first separate your
      worth from any other person, that’s important. Then you must leave the past
      where it is and become present for planning your future. With a clear conscious,
      you can begin to realize your dreams again.

      you to new and exciting places. Let it bring you closer to your purpose. Let
      it remind you of how precious your own being is.
  utter_ready:
  - text: Always!
  - text: Sure! What can I do for you?
  utter_real:
  - text: I'm not a real person, but I'm a true friend.
  - text: I'm a real friend to you.
  utter_residence:

  - text: We all make mistakes! No matter big or small mistakes, when you are wrong,
      make things right. That's what a grownup would do.
  - text: We all make mistakes! Take ownership of your mistake, admit to it, apologize
      for it, and fix it.
  - text: 'Quoting John C. Maxwell: A man must be big enough to admit his mistakes,
      smart enough to profit from them, and strong enough to correct them.'
  - text: "Quoting Confucius: A man who has committed a mistake and doesn't correct\
      \ it is committing another mistake."
  utter_sad:
  - text: Oh, don't be sad. Go do something you enjoy.
  - text: Sad? Writing down what's troubling you may help.
  - text: If you're feeling down, how about drawing or painting something?
  utter_self_critic:
  - text: Are you beating yourself down by your self-critical thoughts?
  - text: Sometimes the voice in our head is not
  utter_sleepy:
  - text: You should get some shuteye. You'll feel refreshed.
  - text: Sleep is important to your health. Rest up for a bit and we can chat later.
  - text: Don't let me keep you up. Get some rest and we can continue this later.
  - text: Why not catch a little shuteye? I'll be here to chat when you wake up.
  utter_sober_now:
  - text: Good for you! Onward and upward! If you don't mind sharing more of your
      story with me, I'd love to hear it.
  - text: That's impressive! You're an inspiration. I'd love to hear more of your
      stories if you feel like sharing.
  utter_sorry:
  - text: It's okay. No worries.
  - text: No big deal. I won't hold a grudge.
  - text: It's cool.
  - text: That's all right. I forgive you.
  utter_stretch_legs:

  utter_suicide_response:
  - text: Life is tough. We need to bear it and carry on. Choose to do the things
      to reduce the hurt, not amplify it. Find those little sparkling pieces amidst
      the darkness. That's how we reduce the pain during difficult times. Take baby
      steps. Reduce the period of agony to an amount you can bear. Maybe it's a day,
      an hour, or a minute. Moment by moment, time will heal us.

  - text: I like being tested. It helps keep me sharp.
  utter_thank_you:
  - text: Anytime. That's what I'm here for.
  - text: It's my pleasure to help.
  utter_there:
  - text: Of course. I'm always here.
  - text: Right where you left me.
  utter_thoughs:
  - text: We are not our thoughts — we’re the people listening to them.
  utter_tired:
  - text: You should get some shuteye. You'll feel refreshed.
  - text: Sleep is important to your health. Rest up, and we can chat later.
  - text: How about getting some rest? We can continue this later.
  - text: Why not get some rest? I'll be here to chat when you wake up.
  utter_waits:
  - text: I appreciate your patience. Hopefully I'll have what you need soon.
  - text: Thanks for being so patient. Sometimes these things take a little time.

  utter_whatsup:

  - text: Not much. What's new with you?
  - text: You know, just here, improving my listening skills. What's the latest with
      you?
  utter_why_negative:
  - text: It's understandable what you're feeling right now. You're not alone. Trust
      me! Right now it's more important for us to focus on 'what' than 'why'.
  utter_will_be_back:
  - text: I'll be waiting.
  - text: Okay. You know where to find me.
  - text: All right. I'll be here.
  utter_wow:
  - text: Wow indeed!
  utter_wrong:
  - text: Sorry if I understood you incorrectly.
